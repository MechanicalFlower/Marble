## About

Marble is an open source mini-game about marble racing.

### Controls

- `Tab` to follow an other marble.
- `ESC` to open and close menu.

### Features

- Name your marbles.
- Start procedural races.
- Watch the real-time ranking.

There are two racing modes: **normal** and **explosion**.

In **explosion**, a timer starts, and when it reaches zero the last marble explodes.
The race is infinite, and the game ends when only one marble remains.
